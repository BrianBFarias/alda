# The Kotlin JS tooling is flaky in that the `jsBrowserProductionWebpack` or
# `jsBrowserWebpack` build task will succeed, but the output JS file won't be
# updated. Deleting the file and re-running the build task from scratch seems to
# work as a workaround, so this script automates that.
#
# This is slower than it could be, which is a shame, but Kotlin JS tooling seems
# to be a mess at this point. Maybe in the future it'll become more intuitive
# and we can get the provided build tasks to work, including incremental
# compilation.
