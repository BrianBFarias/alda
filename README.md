Alda is a text-based programming language for music composition. It allows you
to write and play back music using only a text editor and the command line.

```alda
piano:
  o3
  g8 a b > c d e f+ g | a b > c d e f+ g4
  g8 f+ e d c < b a g | f+ e d c < b a g4
  << g1/>g/>g/b/>d/g
```

> For more examples, see these [example scores](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda-core/tree/master/examples).

The language's design equally favors aesthetics, flexibility and ease of use.

## Features

* Easy to understand, markup-like syntax.
* Designed for musicians who don't know how to program, as well as programmers
  who don't know how to music.
* A score is a text file that can be played using the `alda` command-line tool.
* [Interactive REPL](doc/alda-repl.md) lets you enter Alda code and hear the
  results in real time.
* Supports [writing music
  programmatically](doc/writing-music-programmatically.md) (for algorithmic
  composition, live coding, etc.)
* Create MIDI music using any of the instruments in the [General MIDI Sound
  Set][gm-sound-set]

### TODO

> If you'd like to help, come on in -- [the water's fine](#contributing)!

* [Define and use waveform synthesis instruments](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/issues/100)
* [Import MIDI files](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda-core/issues/25)
* [Export to MusicXML](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda-core/issues/3) for inter-operability with other music software
* [A more robust REPL](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda-client-java/issues/2), tailor-made for editing scores interactively

## Installation

> You must have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download) 8+ installed on your system in order to run Alda.
>
> (Chances are, you already have a recent enough version of Java installed.)

### Mac OS X / Linux

* Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/releases/latest) page and download `alda`.

* Make the file executable:

        chmod +x alda

* Make `alda` available on your `$PATH`:

  > Using `/usr/local/bin` here as an example;
  > you can use any directory on your `$PATH`.

      mv alda /usr/local/bin

### Windows

* Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/releases/latest) page and download `alda.exe`.

* Make the file executable:
  * Go to your downloads folder, right click `alda.exe` to open up its file properties, and click `unblock`

* Copy `alda.exe` to a location that makes sense for you. If you follow standard Windows conventions, this means creating a folder called `Alda` in your `Program Files (x86)` folder, and then moving the `alda.exe` file into it.

* Make `alda` available on your `PATH`:
  *  Go to the Windows `System` Control Panel option, select `Advanced System Settings` and then click on `Environment Variables`, then edit the `PATH` variable (either specifically for your user account or for the system in general) and add `;C:\Program Files (x86)\Alda` to the end. Save this edit. Note that if you placed `alda.exe` in a different folder, you will need to use that folder's full path name in your edit, instead.

You will now be able to run Alda from anywhere in the command prompt by typing `alda`, but note that command prompts that were already open will need to be restarted before they will pick up on the new PATH value.

### Nix

`alda` is available on [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs):

```bash
nix-shell -p alda
```

### Updating Alda

Once you have Alda installed, you can update to the latest version at any time by running:

```
alda update
```

## Demo

First start the Alda server (this may take a minute):

    alda up

To play a file containing Alda code:

    alda play --file examples/bach_cello_suite_no_1.alda

To play arbitrary code at the command line:

    alda play --code "piano: c6 d12 e6 g12~4"

To start an [Alda REPL](doc/alda-repl.md):

    alda repl
